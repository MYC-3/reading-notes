# Reading Notes 5 - HTML Images, CSS Color & Text

## Images
 ```html
 <img src="URL or filepath" alt="descriptive txt for visually impaired">
 ``` 
- `<img>` does not need closing tag.
- `<img>` is an **inline** element.
- Use jpg, png, or gif formats.
- crop/scale images to the appropriate size that your website will be using them in.

## Color

- Colors can be selected in 3 ways:
  1. Color names (red, blue, etc)
  2. RGB values (e.g. 235, 52, 52)
  3. Hex codes (#03ecfc)
- You can change text and background color for each element.
- It is important to have a enough contrast between txt and background to ensure readability.
- RGBA - adds an **alpha** value for transparency.
- hsla = Hue, Saturation, Lightness, and Alpha (transparency)

## Text

- font-family is used to specify which fonts will be used for any text on the page.
- font-size, pretty self explanatory. Measured in pixels, percentage, or em's (equivalent width of the letter m.)
- @font-family lets you use a font by having the user download the font. ***Beware*** of licensing issues.
- font-weight: bold;
- font-style: italic;
- text-transform: uppercase; (lowercase or capitalize)
- text-decoration: underline; (overline, line-through, blink)
- text-align: left; (right, center, justify)
- Styling links you use :link, :visited, :hover
