# Reading Notes 4 - HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions

## HTML Links

Here is an example of a link in HTML:
```html
 <a href="http://www.youtube.com">Youtube</a>
```
Opening link in new window:
```html
 <a href="http://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">Youtube</a>
```
Links can be used to take you to different websites, different pages of the same website, email, and different areas of the current page.

## CSS Layout

Key Terms:
- Normal Flow - Default. Every block-level element is on its own line.
- Relative Positioning
- Absolute Positioning - Does not affect the position of its surrounding elements.
- Fixed Positioning
- Floating Elements - Floating element can be position to the left or right and have other content "flow" around it.
- Z-index - used to control which content appears on top.
- Fixed width layout
- Liquid layout - Pages stretch to fill the width of the screen.

## Javascript Functions

Functions are a set of statements in JavaScript that can be used to perform a task. In more basic terms, a function takes an input and returns an ouput.  
Key parts of a function:
- The name of the function.
- A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
- The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets

It will look something like this:

```javascript
function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}
```
