## About Me

My name is Matt. I have a bachelor's degree in physiology but am interested in breaking in to the tech industry.

### Growth Mindset

To me growth mindset is about understanding that there is ***ALWAYS*** more to learn and improve upon.

In order to keep a growth mindset you should:
- Ask questions
- Be open-minded
- Accept failure and learn from it
