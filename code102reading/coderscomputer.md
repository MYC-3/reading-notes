## About Text Editors

A text editor is pretty much exactly what it sounds like, a program that allows you to write and edit text, especially useful when it comes to coding and building websites.
While there isn't really a definitive ***best*** text editor, there are a couple of key features that are crucial for a great text editor. These features are:
- Code Completion - predictive text that will auto-complete lines of code. This helps by reducing typos/errors and saves time.
- Syntax Highlighting - different portions of your code will be in different colored texts. This makes your code easier to read and helps when trying to spot errors.
- Extensions - Extensions are essentially plug-ins that can increase the capability of your text editor.
- Themes - personalizes your text editor and, when using a darker background, can help reduce eye strain for those long hours of coding.

## About Command Line

A command line, or terminal, is a interface that primarily uses text to control your system.
