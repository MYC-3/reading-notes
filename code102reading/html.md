# Reading 4 - Structure web pages with HTML

## Wireframing

A wireframe is a visual mock-up of what the developer or client wants a webpage to look like. Things like the layout, design, and information are easier usually drawn out in an easy to understand format. Wireframes can be drawn by hand or using computer software.

### Things to keep in mind when Wireframing:

- Who is your target audience? Cater the website experience to the people who will be looking at your page.
- Wireframes are an outline and don't need to be incredibly detailed. Just make sure you have the important parts covered.
- Information heirarchy. What information is more important and therefore needs to be more prominent?

### 3 key principlesof Wireframing:

1. Clarity
2. Confidence
3. Simplicity

## HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

HTML is the code that is used to display the contents of your webpage, contents like images, text, tables, links, etc. HTML is made up of a series of ***elements*** that usually include things like ***tags***, ***attributes***, and ***contents***. HTML is usually combined with CSS and Javascript to make webpages.

## Semantics

Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code. For example, in HTML the `<h1>` element is indicating that the wrapped text is the largest header.

### Benefits of Semantics:

- Indicates keywords that can help with SEO
- Visual signposts to differentiate chunks of info.
- Helps when looking for specific blocks of code
- Makes it easier for other developers to understand your code.
