# Reading Notes 1 - Introductory HTML and Javascript

## HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

HTML is the code that is used to display the contents of your webpage, contents like images, text, tables, links, etc. HTML is made up of a series of ***elements*** that usually include things like ***tags***, ***attributes***, and ***contents***. HTML is usually combined with CSS and Javascript to make webpages.

### Example HTML code:

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<title>This is the Title of the Page</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>This is the Body of the Page</h1>
		<p>Anything within the body of a web page is displayed in the main browser window.</p>
	</body>
</html>
```
Example was taken from *HTML and CSS* by Jon Duckett

```html

```

Block elements will always start on a new line. For example: `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, and `<li>`
On the other hand, inline elements will appear on the same line. For example: `<a>`, `<img>`

The `<div>` element allows you to group together a set of elements.

`<iframe>` is like a smaller window on your page that can see another page.

Escape characters allow you to type the special characters normally reserved by the HTML code like angled brackets, <> , can be written using `&lt` and `&gt`.

New elements of HTML5 help make cleaner code by describing the structure and indicating the purpose of different lines of code.


## Wireframing

A wireframe is a visual mock-up of what the developer or client wants a webpage to look like. Things like the layout, design, and information are easier usually drawn out in an easy to understand format. Wireframes can be drawn by hand or using computer software.

### Things to keep in mind when Wireframing:

- Who is your target audience? Cater the website experience to the people who will be looking at your page.
- Wireframes are an outline and don't need to be incredibly detailed. Just make sure you have the important parts covered.
- Information heirarchy. What information is more important and therefore needs to be more prominent?

### 3 key principlesof Wireframing:

1. Clarity
2. Confidence
3. Simplicity

## About Javascript

Javascript is a just-in-time programming language, which means it is compiled during the execution of the program. Along with HTML and CSS, Javascript is very important to the functionality of the majority of websites on the internet.

### Inputs and Outputs

Javascript can take a user generated inputs and manipulate them to produce an output. For example, a program that allows you to write your name and have the computer greet you.

### Variables

Javascript uses `var` as containers to store data values.
