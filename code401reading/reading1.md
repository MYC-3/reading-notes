# Java Basics

## Variables

- Field = Variable. Used interchangerably.
- Different types of variables:
  - Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields)
  - Class Variables (Static Fields)
  - Local Variables
  - Parameters

## Operators

- Similar to Javascript

|Name                 | Operator             |
|---------------------|----------------------|
|multiplicative       | * / %                |
|additive             | + -                  |
|shift                | << >> >>>            |
|relational           | < > <= >= instanceof |
|equality             | == !=                |
|bitwise AND          | &                    |
|bitwise exclusive OR | ^                    |
|bitwise inclusive OR | \|                   |
|logical AND          | &&                   |
|logical OR           | \|\|                 |
|ternary              | ? :                  |

## Control Flow

- Code is generally executed one line at a time from top to bottom.
- Some exceptions to that include loops, decision-making, branching statements.
  - loops = for, while
  - decision-making = if-then-else
  - branching = break, continue, return

## Compiling

- Code is designed to be written in a way that humans can "easily" interpret and write as opposed to writing them in 1's and 0's.
- When a code is compiling that means the code is being converted in to a form a computer will understand.
