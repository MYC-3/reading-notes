# OO Design

## DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself

- DRY is a principle in software development that aims to eliminate redundant lines of code.
- This leads to cleaner, more easily understandable code.

## Rule of Three

- A rule of thumb that dictates when a piece of code should be refactored to avoid duplication.
- I.e. when a piece of code is used three times it should be refactored as a new process/procedure.
- Duplication is generally considered bad practice because it is harder to read, makes your program bloated, and makes it harder to debug.

## YAGNI = You Aren't Gonna Need It

- A principle that states, you should only add functionality to a program when it is needed and not because you think you'll need it, or you'll need it later.

## MVP = Minimum Viable Product

- The earliest possible build of a product that is usable.
- This allows users to provide feedback and gives developers insight on what needs improvement.
