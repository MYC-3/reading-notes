## Rest
[Notes taken from here](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)<br>
- Who is Roy Fielding?
  - Wrote the first web servers to send info over the internet. Helped create HTTP and REST.
- Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
  - They were not originally designed for that purpose.
- What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
  - a system of applying verbs to nouns like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH`. 
- What does a `GET` do?
  - Gets a resource from a URL. That resource can then be displayed on a page (i.e. an image, text, mp3, video, etc)
  - Retrieves info
- What does a `POST` do?
  - adds from one system to another
- What does `PUT` do?
  - replaces info on another system
- What does `PATCH` do?
  - updates another system
